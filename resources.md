Remember for this course we have a [Slack Workspace](2022tulanemultiagent.slack.com) for this class -- the staff is always there to answer your questions!!

If you need help please check the [discussion board on Canvas!](https://tulane.instructure.com/). We check it regularly to answer common questions on projects and homeworks.  The solution to your question might already be there!
