## Workload and Learning Time

**Note:** This is an upper division computer science course, *it is hard*, there will be a lot of work.  
* You will sometimes have multiple assignments at a time and be responsible for managing the deadlines.  Expect to spend 4-6 hours per week **outside of class** on this course ([Tulane policy is 1-2 hours per hour in class](https://catalog.tulane.edu/)).  
* In order to meet accreditation standards we have over 135 hours of documented learning time this semester.  The following is a rough breakdown of how long you should expect to work on the various types of assignments this semester:  
  * 27 Lectures (1:10h each), additional readings, review, small assignments (20 mins per lecture).
  * Homeworks will generally be 2 hours of work (6x)
  * Projects will be 10-15 hours of work each (6x)
  * Midterm and Final + Study (2x 5h+1h)
  * **Total:** 140 Hours.


For all assignments in this course please have a read over [Aire's Handy Coding Guide](./_projects/codingguide.md). For all code you hand in for this course we expect you to follow these best practices -- if you don't, you'll lose *Professionalism* points.  We're not being mean, just trying to get you ready for coding with other people.

## Discussions

1. For our first group discussion have a listen to the Alan Turing Podcast from BBC4 which is all about his life, his contributions, and a whole lot about the beginning of AI! It's about 50 mins long (you don't need to listen to the extended bit if you don't want to). After listening join the discussion in your group -- you should make a minimum of 3 posts to receive full credit. And we'll chat a bit about this in class.

## Study Sheets for Tests

Upload a PDF of your one page, front and back, hand written, study sheet.  This will be graded based on coverage for the first part of the semester. **This is due before the exam begins!**

* **(5 Points) Professionalism.** Study sheet is well laid out, clear, and organized.
* **(5 Points) Coverage.** Study sheet has good coverage of the material covered in class and in assignments.
