**Update:** As we move to remote teaching Tulane has moved a number of student success resources online.  Please visit the [Virtual Learning Student Support Pages](https://success.tulane.edu/virtual-learning-student-support) for more information.

Given the changing situation I tried to write down all the new course policies all at once.  These are now posted on the main course page under a new heading **Social Isolation Syllabus**.  Please read these in full before our class next week and we will address each in turn.

## Schedule 

I have updated the [course webpage with a new schedule, new readings, and due dates for the rest of the assignments](https://nmattei.github.io/cmps3140/schedule).  I will continue to get slides and additional resources up in the coming days.  

**As an overview:** we will have 2 more homeworks, 1 more required project, 1 optional (for undergrads) and required for grads project, and the final.  We have a total of 11 more lectures and we will be covering Constraint Programming, Basic Logical Agents, Markov Decision Processes, Reinforcement Learning, and then (if we have time) either Bayes Nets/Bayesian Inference or Logic Programming.  One or both of these last elements may be dropped due to losing a week.

## Lectures

I have scheduled all the lectures on Canvas and they should now appear on your schedule.  The syllabus has been updated with a direct link that will not change for the rest of the semester.  Note that I will be generating meeting reports and taking attendance from that every lecture.  If you do not join live it is your responsibility to notify me for alternative arrangements to view the lecture.  All lectures will be recorded and posted within a day (Zoom depending).

## Using Zoom

Please log in and make sure [Zoom](http://tulane.zoom.us) works on your machine **before our first online class on March 24th.**  The classroom will be open on Thursday March 19th and I may be there if anyone wants to talk.  Some notes on Zoom.
  * You will be muted on entry to the classroom.  To talk either un-mute yourself or press space-bar to temporarily unmute.
  * If you press the participants key at the bottom you will see options for non-verbal feedback including raising your hand and a chat feature -- please make use of these during lecture to stop me or ask questions (or just un-mute yourself and start yelling).

## Office Hours and Help

As indicated in the announcement earlier this week I will be holding my regular office hours at the regular time every week (except spring break April 7th and 9th).  The Zoom link is static and on the course syllabus page on Canvas for the rest of the semester. (Note: you will be admitted to the "waiting room" and I'll let you in).
  * In order to support everyone better Arie is going to on demand office hours only except for weeks when assignments are due when he will have his regular time (10-11).  The link for these office hours has been generated and scheduled on Canvas.
  * Please reach out to Arie via email (aglazier@tulane.edu) to set a meeting time outside of these times.
  * We will be monitoring the discussion boards continuously.  If you ask a question there we can answer it for everyone -- indeed if you have an answer to a discussion question please post your answer!  We'll come up with a prize for whomever is most active at the end of the semester on the discussion boards. 

## Extra Instruction

As part of the guidance from the academic affairs office we must do 50 mins of extra instruction (in addition to class time) before the end of the semester.  The current plan for this is to assign about 50 mins of video lectures from my old boss at NICTA related to constraint programming.  They're fun videos and you'll have a short quiz (on Canvas, homework points) about the material in the videos.

This has now been assigned and is due the same day as Homework 4 to line up with our extra instructional days.

## Projects

**Project 2 is due next Thursday March 26th.  Project 3 (Constraints) will be posted before the end of the week as will Project 4 (Reinforcement Learning).**  Both remaining projects will be due the last day of class: April 28th.  Specific notes below.
  * **Project 3** will be **bonus, optional** for undergrads but required for graduate students; it will be due the last day of the semester.  It will be worth 50 points (all other projects are worth 100).  I will post additional material for this project including links for resources from an old class I taught on Constraint Programming.  This project will require a reasonable amount of self study as it will be using MiniZinc which is a totally different language.
  * **Project 4** will be due the last day of semester as well.  We will complete the reinforcement learning part of the PacMan projects.  Note that this will be the most complex of the projects so it is imperative that you begin on this early!  I will post this project in the coming days and please note we will only be doing a subset of the questions.

## Homeworks

We will have some use of Canvas Quizzes in conjunction with the extra instruction period so please watch out for those -- these will only be used for multiple choice.  In general you need to get ready and get a Scan to PDF app ([see useful links here](https://fossbytes.com/best-android-scanner-apps/)).  Scanning is built into many phones now so please get ready.  **We will not accept pictures, you must upload PDFs to Canvas to turn in homeworks from now on.  It is also your responsibility to check your PDFs when they are submitted -- if we can't read them we can't grade them.  If you cannot do this please contact me ASAP.**

## The Final: 

We will be taking our final in the time block that is designated by the registrar, specifically May 6th from 800-1200.  **In order to at least try to make this work I will distribute a PDF on the day via Canvas, you will need to print it (if you do not have access to a printer please contact me ASAP) complete it during the 4 hour block, and then upload a scanned PDF.**
  * You will be graded on your study sheet.  This sheet must be completed and uploaded prior to the test.  The goal here is to force you to think through what will be on the test and prepare.  You will be graded on the comprehensiveness of your review sheet.
  * The final will be open book but closed internet and closed friend.  I don't have a practical way to enforce this so I am relying on your own sense of honor and duty.  I will check but I can only do so much.
