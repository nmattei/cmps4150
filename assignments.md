## Workload and Learning Time

**Note:** This is a upper division / graduate computer science course, *it is hard*, there will be a lot of work.  

* You will sometimes have multiple assignments at a time and be responsible for managing the deadlines.  Expect to spend 4-6 hours per week **outside of class** on this course ([Tulane policy is 1-2 hours per hour in class](https://catalog.tulane.edu/)).
* All written assignments in this course you must turn in a Latex PDF document that is typeset and professional. If you have quesitons about Latex please see the [Template Document](https://www.overleaf.com/read/ccwvxmcmcjtn) we have prepared for hte course. Getting used to writing is one of the must fundamental skills for graduate school and practice makes perfect.
* For all coding assignments in this course please have a read over [Aire's Handy Coding Guide](./_projects/codingguide.md). For all code you hand in for this course we expect you to follow these best practices -- if you don't, you'll lose *Professionalism* points.  We're not being mean, just trying to get you ready for coding with other people.
* You must join the course **Slack Workspace** and check it regularly as that will be the main communications mechanism and where we expect to see evidence of you and your team collaborating.

## Homeworks

Homeworks will generally be posted about a week before they are due. Answers to homeworks are expected to be typed in Latex. If you want to draw figures and take photos that is acceptable. Answers to homework questions are expected to be written in a professional way that is clear.

## Major Project and Presentations

The majority of the grade in this class will be focused on completing a project in a small team (up to 3 students). The ideal is to have each group contain one graduate student and up to two undergrads. We will post project ideas in the **Slack Workspace** for the class.

Writing a research paper is an undertaking that should be approached systematically. The first thing you should do is read one or more papers, as suggested by the course staff or found on your own via [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/) or other resources, that are directly related to your topic. Some example papers that have come from this course or courses similar to it include the following.

* [Flexible Representative Democracy: An Introduction with Binary Issues.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.02921) Ben Abramowitz and Nicholas Mattei.
* [An Empirical Study of Voting Rules and Manipulation with Large Datasets.](http://www.cs.engr.uky.edu/~goldsmit/papers/analysis-comsoc.pdf) Nicholas Mattei, James Forshee, and Judy Goldsmith.
* [PEERNOMINATION: Relaxing Exactness for Increased Accuracy in Peer Selection.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.14939) Nicholas Mattei, Paolo Turrini, and Stanislav Zhydkov.
* [Balancing Lexicographic Fairness and a Utilitarian Objective with Application to Kidney Exchange.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.08286) Duncan McElfresh and John P Dickerson.
* [Diverse Weighted Bipartite b-Matching.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.07134) Faez Ahmed, John P Dickerson, and Mark Fuge.

Additionally you should look into some tips and guides for writing a good research paper. Some that Prof. Mattei recommends are below. Also have a look at the lecture slides on [How to Write a Paper!](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ERq3woEdXPtE141ZSsH5esnp9qiO2JMw?usp=sharing)

* [Mathematical Writing by Donald E. Knuth, Tracy Larrabee, and Paul M. Roberts](http://jmlr.csail.mit.edu/reviewing-papers/knuth_mathematical_writing.pdf)

### Project Proposal (30 Points)

For the first part of the project you should write out a formal project proposal in the Overleaf document that we have started for you. It is important to make sure that all writing occurs in this document so that the course staff can offer advice and even help co-write with you! The project proposal will outline the goals of the project, include a concrete question or goal, and contain 5-8 reference papers that place the project in the academic research literature. Ideally one of the references should be engaged with critically, that is, the proposal should state a formal model or goal of one of the papers and offer a concrete question about what should the plan for investigation will be. The proposal will be graded on the following aspects.

**Submission:** You will submit a PDF of your paper through Canvas. Only one group member should submit the document but all group members full names must be on the title page of the writeup.

**Scoring Rubric**

* *(10 Points) Professionalism:* The document is well organized, contains at least an Introduction, Related Work, and Project Plan sections. The writing is of appropriate quality.
* *(5 Points) References:* There are 5-8 papers in the references and the papers are both relevant to the investigation proposed and properly cited and contextualized in the document.
* *(5 Points) Introduction:* There is an introduction section that places the project goals within the larger context of MultiAgent systems and motivates the problem in a general way.
* *(10 Points) Project Plan:* There is a coherent project plan that is placed in the context of one (or more) references. The plan includes a discussion of the proposed format of the results (e.g., theoretical proofs, code, a formal model, etc.) and the goal is scoped appropriately, i.e., contains a concrete question of what questions are hoped to be answered and how.

### Project Oral Pitch (75 Points)

For the second part of the project you will both give and in class presentation and provide an update to your written report of the project. You should approach the pitch as teaching a mini-class in which you will be teaching your fellow students the basics of your research project: what the question is, why it is important, and what your plan of attack is. You should be prepared to discuss the relevant context of your research in detail including a deep dive in at least one "most relevant" paper to your project.

The oral component will consist of a 18 - 20 minute presentation where you will:

1. Detail the area of multi-agent systems in which you are working, providing enough background so that we can understand your research direction.
2. A clear statement of your research question including an explanation of both why it is significant and why it is novel.
3. A "deep dive" into one, most related research paper where you detail how they answered the same question, and how your approach is different. You should get into the details of their algorithms or code as part of this deep dive.
4. Initial results and steps that have been completed so far, e.g., statement of a formal model, code, graphs etc.
5. A concrete plan for the rest of the semester including at least 3 project milestones.

The written component will consist of submitting an updated version of your project proposal that has taken into account the feedback from the first round as well as updated results and progress sections. There should be additional background and related work that has come from working on the oral presentation.

**Submission:** You should **combine the PDF of your slides and your paper into one document** and submit it through Canvas. Only one group member should submit the document but all group members full names must be on the title page of the writeup.

**Scoring Rubric**

* *(10 Points) Professionalism:* The document is well-organized, and well-written. The document contains at least an Introduction, Related Work, and Project Plan sections. The writing is of appropriate quality for an undergraduate/graduate level course. The oral presentation was well-timed, and contained a reasonable number of slides (15-20) that were neat and well-organized.
* *(10 Points) Problem Justification:* There is an Introduction section that places the project goals within the larger context of MultiAgent Systems and motivates the problem in a general way. You should clearly answer the questions: Why is this problem interesting or important? What is it about this problem that makes it non-trivial to solve? Once your project is complete, how might one use the information and insight your project provides?
* *(10 Points) Problem Setting/Model:* There is a clear statement of the problem as a model/algorithm/task that needs to be developed or completed. This should be formal in nature, e.g., if it is an algorithm clearly state the inputs and outputs. You should clearly state why this model is relevant to the problem and how it differs from existing results. For each decision you make in constructing your model, you must explain or justify that decision. For example, if preferences are drawn from a distribution how did you choose what distribution to use?
* *(10 Points) References:* There at least 10 papers in the references and the papers are both relevant to the investigation proposed and properly cited and contextualized in the document and were discussed in the oral presentation.
* *(15 Points) Deep Dive:* The deep dive in the oral presentation was a closely related paper that was addressed in significant depth and was also clear.
* *(10 Points) Initial Results:* The initial results detailed (code, model, algorithm) was reasonable, clearly explained, and shows a clear path towards a goal.
* *(10 Points) Project Plan:* There is a coherent project plan that is placed in the context of both the references and the current work. The plan includes a discussion of the proposed format of the results (e.g., theoretical proofs, code, a formal model, etc.) and the goal is scoped appropriately, i.e., contains a concrete question of what questions are hoped to be answered and how. You may present multiple avenues that you are considering, but must explain the differences and value of each one.

### Final Project Presentation (75 Points)

For the third part of the project you will both give a revised and expanded in class presentation. You should approach this much more like a research report (even if you haven't finished all the work), [recall Prof. Mattei's example 20 min presentation from class](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ERq3woEdXPtE141ZSsH5esnp9qiO2JMw?usp=sharing).

You should start from the slides and pitch you used in the Oral Pitch. Make sure that you update the slides with any feedback that was given for that part of the project. Nothing makes Dr. Mattei more sad then when he asked you to fix something and you didn't fix it. You will want to remove most of the deep dive for this part and instead replace that part with an clear and concise explanation of your (initial) results. If not everything is done then you need to clearly state what will be done for the final writeup (maybe even a placeholder graph) along with the plan to complete that work by the final writeup deadline.

The oral component will consist of a 18 - 20 minute presentation where you will:

1. Detail the area of multi-agent systems in which you are working, providing enough background so that we can understand your research direction.
2. A clear statement of your research question including an explanation of both why it is significant and why it is novel.
3. A clear statement of the formal model/framework of your research: you should clearly and exactly specify the question, method of evaluation, formal model of the problem, and the metrics of evaluation you will use.
4. Presentation of results this should include datasets, graphs/charts, proofs, and other concrete results that have arisen from your research. Reminder, do not put code on a slide, that makes Dr. Mattei angry.
5. Conclusion and a concrete set of questions or experiments that are planned to be included in the final document. This should be fairly detailed and provide a framework for your final writing.

**Submission:** You should **submit the PDF of your slides** through Canvas. Only one group member should submit the document but all group members full names must be on the title slide.

**Scoring Rubric**

* *(10 Points) Professionalism:* The slides/presentation is well-organized, and well-written. The slides contains an Introduction, Related Work, Formal Model, Initial Results, and Conclusion sections. The oral presentation was well-timed, and contained a reasonable number of slides (15-20) that were neat and well-organized.
* *(15 Points) Introduction / Problem Justification:* There is an Introduction that places the project goals within the larger context of MultiAgent Systems and motivates the problem in a general way. You should clearly answer the questions: Why is this problem interesting or important? What is it about this problem that makes it non-trivial to solve? Once your project is complete, how might one use the information and insight your project provides?
* *(15 Points) Problem Setting/ Formal Model:* There is a clear statement of the problem as a model/algorithm/task that needs to be developed or completed. This should be formal in nature, e.g., if it is an algorithm clearly state the inputs and outputs. You should clearly state why this model is relevant to the problem and how it differs from existing results. For each decision you make in constructing your model, you must explain or justify that decision. For example, if preferences are drawn from a distribution how did you choose what distribution to use?
* *(15 Points) Results:* You have clearly and exactly specify the question, method of evaluation, formal model of the problem, and the metrics of evaluation you will use. You have provided evidence, via proof, graph, or example, that you are on track to answer your initial research question. E.g., A graph showing initial comparative results between two candidate algorithms.
* *(15 Points) Conclusion / Project Finishing Plan:* There is a coherent path to completion of the project. The plan should include a clear statement of the expected results and how they will be obtained. Example graphs/output/results should be given to help explain how this will fit in the final paper. You may present multiple avenues that you are considering, but must explain the differences and value of each one.
* *(5 Points) References:* References were well used and cited on the slides where necessary for the presentation.

### Final Project Writeup (120 Points)

For the fourth and final portion of the project you will submit a final, written paper. You should make sure that you have corrected any and all suggestions made by Prof. Mattei from earlier versions of the paper. Additionally you should make sure you follow all the suggestions laid out in the [How to Write a Paper!](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ERq3woEdXPtE141ZSsH5esnp9qiO2JMw?usp=sharing).

In terms of formatting please ensure your paper uses the package `natbib` and cites are done properly with [\citet](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Natbib_citation_styles) and using the style `plainnat`. Your paper should also be one-half spaced, have line numbers, and the other settings below which you really should just copy and paste into your pre-amble.

The paper will be graded both on the quality of the writing, the interestingness of the research, and your ability to follow the process and form of research. Your work does not have to be ground-breaking or novel to earn high marks; likewise an interesting result that is not placed properly in the research and explained clearly will not get a good grade. Both good ideas and good form are part of the scientific process and both will carry equal weight in this assignment. I would rather see less-interesting but well investigated questions over papers I cannot read.

The paper itself should contain the following sections (please come up with a creative one for the work), in this order, as described in the [How to Write a Paper!](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ERq3woEdXPtE141ZSsH5esnp9qiO2JMw?usp=sharing) lecture.

1. Abstract
2. Introduction
3. Preliminaries & Problem Formulation
4. Related Work
5. Our Method
6. Theoretical Results
7. Empirical Results
8. Discussion and Conclusions
9. References
10. Appendices

Note that you should have something to say for both Section 6 and Section 7 -- if you do not please discuss this with us before turning in the paper. You should be able to say one or two formal things about your algorithm or methods both empirically and theoretically.

**Submission:** You should **submit the PDF of your paper** through Canvas. Only one group member should submit the document but all group members full names must be on the title page of the writeup.

**Scoring Rubric**

* *(10 Points) Professionalism:* The paper is well-organized, and well-written, contains the proper sections and proper formatting. The written English is in the active, present voice, the arguments are well organized, and the document is well presented as described.
* *(25 Points) Peer Evaluation:* Before the deadline please send a message via Slack, Canvas, or Email to Prof. Mattei. You should clearly do 2 things: (1) explain the parts of the project that you took responsibility for and (2) assign 100 percent of effort to both yourself and the rest of your team.
* *(15 Points) Introduction / Problem Justification:* There is an Introduction that places the project goals within the larger context of MultiAgent Systems and motivates the problem in a general way. You should clearly answer the questions: Why is this problem interesting or important? What is it about this problem that makes it non-trivial to solve? Once your project is complete, how might one use the information and insight your project provides?
* *(15 Points) Related Work:* There at least 10 papers in the references and the papers are both relevant to the investigation proposed and properly cited and contextualized in the document. References are used where necessary to back up statements and assertions.
* *(15 Points) Problem Setting/ Formal Model:* There is a clear statement of the problem as a model/algorithm/task that needs to be developed or completed. This should be formal in nature, e.g., if it is an algorithm clearly state the inputs and outputs. You should clearly state why this model is relevant to the problem and how it differs from existing results. For each decision you make in constructing your model, you must explain or justify that decision. For example, if preferences are drawn from a distribution how did you choose what distribution to use?
* *(15 Points) Methodology / Reproducibility:* Your algorithm / experiment / model etc. and the process you will use to evaluate it is clearly written, is technical in nature, and clearly describes the methods you will use to the point that someone else would be able to reproduce the methods you have used. You have clearly and exactly specified the question, method of evaluation, formal model of the problem, and the metrics of evaluation you will use.
* *(15 Points) Results:*  You have provided evidence, via proof, graph, and/or example, that you have completed a comprehensive investigation of your proposed work. The presented results should be coherent and tell a story about what you did and what you found.
* *(10 Points) Conclusion / Discussion:* There is a coherent discussion of the results of the project, the practical implications of those results, and a clear line of next questions you or someone else could work on. Do not oversell but rather clearly articulate both the accomplishments and limitations of your work.
