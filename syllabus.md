# Overview / Catalog Course Description

This course has two main goals. The first one is to give a broad overview of the fundamentals of multi-agent systems (MAS). MAS are playing an increasingly important role in Artificial Intelligence as distributed resources push for highly distributed forms of intelligence. The second aim is to provide a more in-depth discussion of selected MAS topics: game theory and voting from a computational point of view. Situated at the nexus between economics and computer science, these research areas provide a perfect example of interdisciplinary cross-fertilization and mutual enrichment and lie at the core of multi-agent systems theory. The course will provide the student with an understanding of how self-interested behavior and coordination can be formally modeled and implemented in societies of artificial agents.

*Prerequisite(s):* CMPS 2200 Introduction to Algorithms or consent of instructor.

**Note.** This is a programming and mathematics intensive class.  Students are expected to know the basics of Python and be able to navigate a Linux/Unix command prompt.  Likewise a working understanding of graph theory, probability theory, and an understanding of basic algorithms is expected.

## Course Learning Outcomes

At the conclusion of this course students will be able to:
* Define and intelligent agent and be able to identify the different environmental factors at play in the design of an agent.
* Be able to define and analyze a rational agent using techniques from cooperative and non-cooperative game theory.
* Implement group decision making and aggregation methods via voting and judgement aggregation.
* Apply optimization constraints to multi-agent resource allocation settings.

Students should be comfortable with programming in at least one language (preferably [Python](https://www.python.org/)) and have had a reasonable amount of math including some linear algebra and algorithms.  You you should know what a matrix is and you should be comfortable with everything in CMPS/MATH 2170.  There are many helpful tutorials and background material at the [Links & Resources Page](./resources.md), please make use of it.

## Program-Level Outcomes

This course fulfills the requirement of **one** of the CMPS 3000-level or above courses required for the coordinate major in computer science.  Students need to complete three such courses in order to complete the requirements for a coordinate major.  For more information on the coordinate major please see the requirements at [the Registrar's Website](https://catalog.tulane.edu/science-engineering/computer-science/computer-science-coordinate-major/#requirementstext)

# Evaluation Procedures and Grading Criteria

This course will consist of six distinct grading areas.  Note that all point values described below for individual assignments are subject to change, the area percentages will remain the same.
*   5% - Attendance and Participation
*   20% - Written Homeworks
*   10% - Midterm Exam
*   10% - Final Exam
*   55% - Final Project
  * 5% Project Proposal
  * 10% Project Checkup/Pitch
  * 15% Project Presentation
  * 25% Project Writeup


### Attendance

Attendance will be monitored through an in-class survey (nearly) every day of class. You are required to fill out this survey every day, synchronously in class unless you contact me to make alternative arrangements.

### Written Homeworks (2-4 hours each). 

We will have ~4 written homeworks throughout the semester.  You are expected to write your answers individually.  You are encouraged to discuss homework problems in small groups, **as long as you give credit to whomever you discussed the topics with at the top of your homework**.  You are strongly discouraged from seeking solutions online; if you do, **you must cite any sources explicitly you use for each problem**.  Copying of homework from other students or from other sources is strictly prohibited. Obtaining a solution from another source without citing the source is plagiarism.

### Midterm/Final Exam

There will be a **take-home** Midterm and Final for this course. You will have 24 hours or more for each of these and you will turn them in via PDF upload on Canvas. These must be completed individually. More details as the tests approach.

### Class Presentation and Final Project

The majority of the grade in this class will be focused on completing a project in a small team (up to 3 students). The ideal is to have each group contain one graduate student and up to two undergrads. We will post project ideas in the **Slack Workspace** for the class and students can propose projects and form teams there. The grades for the Project are broken down with rubrics on the [assignments page](./assignments.md). In general a project will contain the following sub-grades.
1. **5% Project Proposal** - The project proposal will outline the goals of the project, include a concrete question or goal, and contain 5-8 reference papers that place the project in the academic research literature.
2. **10% Project Checkup/Pitch** - Near mid-term your team will make a 10-15 minute presentation where you will describe the problem you are attacking and outline one relevant research paper that you ar building on. This talk should be in depth enough that all students understand the problem and the context of the academic literature you are working within.
3. **15% Project Presentation** - Towards the end of the semester your team will make a 15-20 minute presentation of your complete project. This should be an in-depth talk that clearly outlines the problem, places it in the literature, and describes your novel contribution and results. 
4. **25% Project Writeup** - Research formatted paper in LaTeX. Should be written with the goal of actually being published. Should contain at a minimum introduction; related work; clear problem statement and formal description; novel algorithm, model, or theory; evaluation; and conclusions. 

###

**Note:** All code for this class is expected to follow best practices laid out in the [Programming Guide](./_projects/codingguide.md).

### Midterm and Final Exam 

This will be a written, close book, in class (online) exam.  You are allowed one **hand-written** cheat sheet, front and back, 8.5x11 inch paper.  You will be required to turn in this cheat sheet **before** the actual exam and it will be graded for completeness. The final is cumulative.  This semester both exams will take place online, however you must be in the Zoom call to turn in and receive credit for taking the exam unless prior arrangements have been made. **You must earn at least a 60% average between the two exams to pass the course.**

### Additional Work For Graduate Students

Graduate students are expected to lead project teams or work individually for this course. Hence their additional work is that of being lead researcher on a team of undergraduates.

## Policies Related to Turnig In Work

* All work will be turned in on [Canvas](https://tulane.instructure.com/).  All work will either be distributed via [Canvas](https://tulane.instructure.com/) or via this course webpage.

* All work will be due **at class time on the day assigned**.  This means turning things in during or after class is considered one day late.  This will be consistent throughout the semester.

### Late Work Policy. 

All work must be turned in on time unless explicit consent for outstanding circumstances is given beforehand (or in the case of illness, with a documented absence after).  Any late work will be penalized at **10% of the total assignment value per day up to 5 days late, after which it will not be accepted**.  The exception to this rule is if work solutions are presented in class (as is the case with labs and quizzes).  **After the work is presented in class, no late work will be accepted.**

### Late Tokens. 

At the start of this semester you each are holding **3 late tokens** which can be redeemed at any time for **programming projects and homeworks**.  Each token is worth one additional day, to use at your discretion.  These tokens will be automatically applied and you do not need to let us know.  These tokens have no cash value.  If you are still holding tokens at the end of the semester they will automatically be converted to 1% bonus points on your **projects** grade.

## Final Grade Policy.

The weighted average will determine your letter grade roughly as follows, +/- grades will be given for borderline cases.
* A >= 92%, A- >= 90%,
* B+ >= 88%, B >= 82%, B- >= 80%,
* C+ >= 78%, C >= 72%, C- >= 70%,
* D+ >= 68%, D >= 62%, D- >= 60%,
* F < 59%

**All grades will be posted on [Canvas](https://tulane.instructure.com/) throughout the semester.**

## Schedule and Workload

See the [Schedule Page](./schedule.md) for the schedule and assignments.

This is an upper division computer science course, *it is hard*, there will be a lot of work. You will sometimes have multiple assignments at a time and be responsible for managing the deadlines. Expect to spend 4-6 hours per week **outside of class** on this course ([Tulane policy is 1-2 hours per hour in class](https://catalog.tulane.edu/)).  

## Attendance

**Students are required to attend all classes and labs unless they are ill or prevented from attending by exceptional circumstances and with a valid excuse note.** Students are responsible for notifying instructors about absences that result from serious illnesses, injuries, or critical personal problems.  **Students with frequent absences will be reported and/or removed from the course according to university policy.**

Faculty and students must comply with University policies on COVID-19 testing and isolation, which are [located here](https://tulane.edu/covid-19/health-strategies). Faculty and students must wear face coverings in all common areas, including classrooms, and follow social distancing rules. Failure to comply is a violation of the Code of Student Conduct and students will be subject to University discipline, which can include suspension or permanent dismissal.

If a student cannot attend class for any reason, the student is responsible for communicating with their instructors to make up any work they may miss. Faculty will provide online options for class participation, outlined in this document, and unless a student is seriously ill, they are expected to use this option. The University Health Center will provide documentation verifying a student is ill, as well as verification that a student may return to class. With the approval of the Newcomb - Tulane College dean, an instructor may have a student who has excessive absences involuntarily withdrawn from a course with a WF grade after written warning at any time during the semester.

## ADA / Accessibility Statement

Tulane University strives to make all learning experiences as accessible as possible. If you anticipate or experience academic barriers based on your disability, please let me know immediately so that we can privately discuss options. I will never ask for medical documentation from you to support potential accommodation needs. Instead, to establish reasonable accommodations, I may request that you register with the Goldman Center for Student Accessibility.  After registration, make arrangements with me as soon as possible to discuss your accommodations so that they may be implemented in a timely fashion. Goldman Center contact information: goldman@tulane.edu; (504) 862-8433; [http://accessibility.tulane.edu](http://accessibility.tulane.edu).

## Recording of Class Sessions

Classes will be recorded and the recordings will be posted to Canvas. Students may not post a class recording elsewhere, either wholly or in part. Instructors may use a class recording in another course or in a subsequent semester. 

## Code of Academic Conduct and Academic Integrity

This course will follow Tulane's Code of Academic Conduct. Cheating will be reported to the Associate Dean of Newcomb-Tulane College. Discussion is encouraged. However, what you turn in must be your own. You may not read another classmate’s solutions or copy a solution from the web.  **I will be running checks on the code turned in for plagiarism.  If plagiarism is detected the minimum penalty is a 0 on the assignment and being reported, however, you may automatically fail this course at my discretion.**

To be more clear (text from Hal Daumé III): **Any assignment or exam that is handed in must be your own work (unless otherwise stated). However, talking with one another to understand the material better is strongly encouraged.** Recognizing the distinction between cheating and cooperation is very important. If you copy someone else's solution, you are cheating. If you let someone else copy your solution, you are cheating (this includes posting solutions online in a public place). If someone dictates a solution to you, you are cheating.

Everything you hand in must be in your own words, and based on your own understanding of the solution. If someone helps you understand the problem during a high-level discussion, you are not cheating. **We strongly encourage students to help one another understand the material presented in class, in the book, and general issues relevant to the assignments.  We also encourage the use of online resources to understand and clarify things, but not taking results verbatim.** When taking an exam, you must work independently. Any collaboration during an exam will be considered cheating. Any student who is caught cheating will be given an F in the course and referred to the University Office of Student Conduct. Please don't take that chance – if you're having trouble understanding the material, please let me know and I will be more than happy to help.

The Code of Academic Conduct applies to all undergraduate students, full-time and part-time, at Tulane University. Tulane University expects and requires behavior compatible with its high standards of scholarship. By accepting admission to the university, a student accepts its regulations (i.e., [Code of Academic Conduct](https://college.tulane.edu/code-of-academic-conduct) and the [Code of Student Conduct](https://conduct.tulane.edu/resources/code-student-conduct)) and acknowledges the right of the university to take disciplinary action, including suspension or expulsion, for conduct judged unsatisfactory or disruptive.

## Title IX

Tulane University recognizes the inherent dignity of all individuals and promotes respect for all people. As such, Tulane is committed to providing an environment free of all forms of discrimination including sexual and gender-based discrimination, harassment, and violence like sexual assault, intimate partner violence, and stalking. If you (or someone you know) has experienced or is experiencing these types of behaviors, know that you are not alone. Resources and support are available: you can learn more at [http://allin.tulane.edu](https://allin.tulane.edu/). Any and all of your communications on these matters will be treated as either “Confidential” or “Private” as explained in the chart below. Please know that if you choose to confide in me I am mandated by the university to report to the Title IX Coordinator, as Tulane and I want to be sure you are connected with all the support the university can offer. You do not need to respond to outreach from the university if you do not want. You can also make a report yourself, including an anonymous report, through the form [http://tulane.edu/concerns](http://tulane.edu/concerns).
