## Workload and Learning Time

**Note:** This is a upper division / graduate computer science course, *it is hard*, there will be a lot of work.  

* You will sometimes have multiple assignments at a time and be responsible for managing the deadlines.  Expect to spend 4-6 hours per week **outside of class** on this course ([Tulane policy is 1-2 hours per hour in class](https://catalog.tulane.edu/)).
* All written assignments in this course you must turn in a Latex PDF document that is typeset and professional. Getting used to writing is one of the must fundamental skills for graduate school and practice makes perfect.
* For all coding assignments in this course please have a read over [Aire's Handy Coding Guide](./_projects/codingguide.md). For all code you hand in for this course we expect you to follow these best practices -- if you don't, you'll lose *Professionalism* points.  We're not being mean, just trying to get you ready for coding with other people.
* You must join the course **Slack Workspace** and check it regularly as that will be the main communications mechanism and where we expect to see evidence of you and your team collaborating.

## Major Project and Presentations

The majority of the grade in this class will be focused on completing a project in a small team (up to 3 students). The ideal is to have each group contain one graduate student and up to two undergrads. We will post project ideas in the **Slack Workspace** for the class.

Writing a research paper is an undertaking that should be approached systematically. The first thing you should do is read one or more papers, as suggested by the course staff or found on your own via [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/) or other resources, that are directly related to your topic. Some example papers that have come from this course or courses similar to it include the following.
* [Flexible Representative Democracy: An Introduction with Binary Issues.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.02921) Ben Abramowitz and Nicholas Mattei.
* [An Empirical Study of Voting Rules and Manipulation with Large Datasets.](http://www.cs.engr.uky.edu/~goldsmit/papers/analysis-comsoc.pdf) Nicholas Mattei, James Forshee, and Judy Goldsmith.
* [PEERNOMINATION: Relaxing Exactness for Increased Accuracy in Peer Selection.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.14939) Nicholas Mattei, Paolo Turrini, and Stanislav Zhydkov.
* [Balancing Lexicographic Fairness and a Utilitarian Objective with Application to Kidney Exchange.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.08286) Duncan McElfresh and John P Dickerson.
* [Diverse Weighted Bipartite b-Matching.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.07134) Faez Ahmed, John P Dickerson, and Mark Fuge.

Additionally you should look into some tips and guides for writing a good research paper. Some that Prof. Mattei recommends are below.
* [Hal Varian on "How to Build an Economic Model in Your Spare Time."](https://people.ischool.berkeley.edu/~hal/Papers/how.pdf)
* [The Science of Scientific Writing by George D. Gopen and Judith A. Swan](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~swanson/papers/science-of-writing.pdf)
* [Ten Simple Rules for Mathematical Writing by Dimitri Bertsekas](http://www.mit.edu/~dimitrib/Ten_Rules.pdf)
* [Mathematical Writing by Donald E. Knuth, Tracy Larrabee, and Paul M. Roberts](http://jmlr.csail.mit.edu/reviewing-papers/knuth_mathematical_writing.pdf)

### Project Proposal (30 Points)

For the first part of the project you should write out a formal project proposal in the Overleaf document that we have started for you. It is important to make sure that all writing occurs in this document so that the course staff can offer advice and even help co-write with you! The project proposal will outline the goals of the project, include a concrete question or goal, and contain 5-8 reference papers that place the project in the academic research literature. Ideally one of the references should be engaged with critically, that is, the proposal should state a formal model or goal of one of the papers and offer a concrete question about what should the plan for investigation will be. The proposal will be graded on the following aspects.

**Submission:** You will submit a PDF of your paper through Canvas. Only one group member should submit the document but all group members full names must be on the title page of the writeup.

**Scoring Rubric**

* *(10 Points) Professionalism:* The document is well organized, contains at least an Introduction, Related Work, and Project Plan sections. The writing is of appropriate quality.
* *(5 Points) References:* There are 5-8 papers in the references and the papers are both relevant to the investigation proposed and properly cited and contextualized in the document.
* *(5 Points) Introduction:* There is an introduction section that places the project goals within the larger context of MultiAgent systems and motivates the problem in a general way.
* *(10 Points) Project Plan:* There is a coherent project plan that is placed in the context of one (or more) references. The plan includes a discussion of the proposed format of the results (e.g., theoretical proofs, code, a formal model, etc.) and the goal is scoped appropriately, i.e., contains a concrete question of what questions are hoped to be answered and how.

### Project Oral Pitch (75 Points)

For the second part of the project you will both give and in class presentation and provide an update to your written report of the project. You should approach the pitch as teaching a mini-class in which you will be teaching your fellow students the basics of your research project: what the question is, why it is important, and what your plan of attack is. You should be prepared to discuss the relevant context of your research in detail including a deep dive in at least one "most relevant" paper to your project.

The oral component will consist of a 18 - 20 minute presentation where you will:

1. Detail the area of multi-agent systems in which you are working, providing enough background so that we can understand your research direction.
2. A clear statement of your research question including an explanation of both why it is significant and why it is novel.
3. A "deep dive" into one, most related research paper where you detail how they answered the same question, and how your approach is different. You should get into the details of their algorithms or code as part of this deep dive.
4. Initial results and steps that have been completed so far, e.g., statement of a formal model, code, graphs etc.
5. A concrete plan for the rest of the semester including at least 3 project milestones.

The written component will consist of submitting an updated version of your project proposal that has taken into account the feedback from the first round as well as updated results and progress sections. There should be additional background and related work that has come from working on the oral presentation.

**Submission:** You should combine the PDF of your slides and your paper into one document and submit it through Canvas. Only one group member should submit the document but all group members full names must be on the title page of the writeup.

**Scoring Rubric**

* *(10 Points) Professionalism:* The document is well organized, contains at least an Introduction, Related Work, and Project Plan sections. The writing is of appropriate quality. The oral presentation was well timed, contained a reasonable number of slides (15-20) that were neat and well organized.
* *(10 Points) Problem Setting and Justification:* There is an introduction section that places the project goals within the larger context of MultiAgent systems and motivates the problem in a general way. The research question is clear and significance was established.
* *(10 Points) References:* There at least 10 papers in the references and the papers are both relevant to the investigation proposed and properly cited and contextualized in the document and were discussed in the oral presentation.
* *(15 Points) Deep Dive:* The deep dive in the oral presentation was a closely related paper that was addressed in significant depth and was also clear.
* *(10 Points) Initial Results:* The initial results detailed (code, model, algorithm) was reasonable, clearly explained, and shows a clear path towards a goal.
* *(10 Points) Project Plan:* There is a coherent project plan that is placed in the context of both the references and the current work. The plan includes a discussion of the proposed format of the results (e.g., theoretical proofs, code, a formal model, etc.) and the goal is scoped appropriately, i.e., contains a concrete question of what questions are hoped to be answered and how.
