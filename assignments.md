## Workload and Learning Time

**Note:** This is a upper division / graduate computer science course, *it is hard*, there will be a lot of work.  
* You will sometimes have multiple assignments at a time and be responsible for managing the deadlines.  Expect to spend 4-6 hours per week **outside of class** on this course ([Tulane policy is 1-2 hours per hour in class](https://catalog.tulane.edu/)).
* For all assignments in this course please have a read over [Aire's Handy Coding Guide](./_projects/codingguide.md). For all code you hand in for this course we expect you to follow these best practices -- if you don't, you'll lose *Professionalism* points.  We're not being mean, just trying to get you ready for coding with other people.
* For the project you must use Latex and join the class slack channel. 

## Major Project and Presentations

The majority of the grade in this class will be focused on completing a project in a small team (up to 3 students). The ideal is to have each group contain one graduate student and up to two undergrads. We will post project ideas in the **Slack Workspace** for the class.

Writing a research paper is an undertaking that should be approached systematically. The first thing you should do is read one or more papers, as suggested by the course staff or found on your own via [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/) or other resources, that are directly related to your topic. Some example papers that have come from this course or courses similar to it include the following.
* [Flexible Representative Democracy: An Introduction with Binary Issues.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.02921) Ben Abramowitz and Nicholas Mattei.
* [An Empirical Study of Voting Rules and Manipulation with Large Datasets.](http://www.cs.engr.uky.edu/~goldsmit/papers/analysis-comsoc.pdf) Nicholas Mattei, James Forshee, and Judy Goldsmith.
* [PEERNOMINATION: Relaxing Exactness for Increased Accuracy in Peer Selection.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.14939) Nicholas Mattei, Paolo Turrini, and Stanislav Zhydkov.
* [Balancing Lexicographic Fairness and a Utilitarian Objective with Application to Kidney Exchange.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.08286) Duncan McElfresh and John P Dickerson.
* [Diverse Weighted Bipartite b-Matching.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.07134) Faez Ahmed, John P Dickerson, and Mark Fuge.

Additionally you should look into some tips and guides for writing a good research paper. Some that Prof. Mattei recommends are below.
* [Hal Varian on "How to Build an Economic Model in Your Spare Time."](https://people.ischool.berkeley.edu/~hal/Papers/how.pdf)
* [The Science of Scientific Writing by George D. Gopen and Judith A. Swan](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~swanson/papers/science-of-writing.pdf)
* [Ten Simple Rules for Mathematical Writing by Dimitri Bertsekas](http://www.mit.edu/~dimitrib/Ten_Rules.pdf)
* [Mathematical Writing by Donald E. Knuth, Tracy Larrabee, and Paul M. Roberts](http://jmlr.csail.mit.edu/reviewing-papers/knuth_mathematical_writing.pdf)

### Project Proposal (30 Points)

For the first part of the project you should write out a formal project proposal in the Overleaf document that we have started for you. It is important to make sure that all writing occurs in this document so that the course staff can offer advice and even help co-write with you! The project proposal will outline the goals of the project, include a concrete question or goal, and contain 5-8 reference papers that place the project in the academic research literature. Ideally one of the references should be engaged with critically, that is, the proposal should state a formal model or goal of one of the papers and offer a concrete question about what should the plan for investigation will be. The proposal will be graded on the following aspects.

**Scoring Rubric**
* *(10 Points) Professionalism:* The document is well organized, contains at least an Introduction, Related Work, and Project Plan sections. The writing is of appropriate quality.
* *(5 Points) References:* There are 5-8 papers in the references and the papers are both relevant to the investigation proposed and properly cited and contextualized in the document.
* *(5 Points) Introduction:* There is an introduction section that places the project goals within the larger context of MultiAgent systems and motivates the problem in a general way.
* *(10 Points) Project Plan:* There is a coherent project plan that is placed in the context of one (or more) references. The plan includes a discussion of the proposed format of the results (e.g., theoretical proofs, code, a formal model, etc.) and the goal is scoped appropriately, i.e., contains a concrete question of what questions are hoped to be answered and how.

## Study Sheets for Tests

Upload a PDF of your one page, front and back, hand written, study sheet.  This will be graded based on coverage for the first part of the semester. **This is due before the exam begins!**

* **(5 Points) Professionalism.** Study sheet is well laid out, clear, and organized.
* **(5 Points) Coverage.** Study sheet has good coverage of the material covered in class and in assignments.
